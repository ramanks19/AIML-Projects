## Projects Done
**1. Statistical Learning**
   - Covers Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization and Statistical Inference.
      - **Project link:** [Applied Stats](https://github.com/ramanks19/AIML-Projects/blob/main/01.%20Applied%20Statistics/Project%201%20-%20Statistical%20Learning_Healthcare.ipynb)
         - This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, bmi, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.

**2. Supervised Machine Learning**
   - Covers Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifiers and K-NN Classification
      - **Project link:** [Supervised Machine Learning](https://github.com/ramanks19/AIML-Projects/blob/main/02.%20Supervised%20Machine%20Learning/Project%202%20-%20Supervised%20Learning_Banking.ipynb)
        - Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm in order to select the best performing one.

**3. Ensemble Techniques**
   - Covers EDA, Logistic Regression, KNN Classifiers, SVM Classifiers, Naive Bayes, Ensemble, Decision Trees, Bagging
      - **Project link:** [Ensemble Techniques](https://github.com/ramanks19/AIML-Projects/blob/main/03.%20Ensemble%20Techniques/Project%203%20-%20Ensemble%20Learning_Medical.ipynb)
         - Involved using classification algorithms and Ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Bagging etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalise the model for prediction.

**4. Unsupervised Machine Learning**
   - Covers Support Vector Machines, Principal Component Analysis, Classification
      - **Project link:** [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/ramanks19/AIML-Projects/blob/main/04.%20Unsupervised%20Machine%20Learning/Project%204%20-%20Unsupervised%20Learning_Object_Recognition.ipynb)
         - Classified vehicles into different types based on silhouettes which may be viewed from many angles. Used PCA in order to reduce dimensionality and SVM for classification
