**1. Statistical Learning**
   - Covers Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization and Statistical Inference.
      - **Project link:** [Applied Stats](https://github.com/ramanks19/AIML-Projects/blob/main/01.%20Applied%20Statistics/Project%201%20-%20Statistical%20Learning_Healthcare.ipynb)
         - This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, bmi, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence
           to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.
         
         * ***[Do charges of people who smoke differs significantly from the people who don't](https://github.com/ramanks19/AIMLProjects/blob/main/01.%20Applied%20Statistics/images/1.%20people%20who%20smoke%20differ%20significantly%20from%20the%20people%20that%20don't.png)***

**3. Ensemble Techniques**
   - Covers EDA, Logistic Regression, KNN Classifiers, SVM Classifiers, Naive Bayes, Ensemble, Decision Trees, Bagging
      - **Project link:** [Ensemble Techniques](https://github.com/ramanks19/AIML-Projects/blob/main/03.%20Ensemble%20Techniques/Project%203%20-%20Ensemble%20Learning_Medical.ipynb)
         - Involved using classification algorithms and Ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Bagging etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalise the model for prediction.
